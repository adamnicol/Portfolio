# Portfolio
My online portfolio and blog. This was intended as a learning project to refresh my knowledge of web development and to learn modern frameworks and tools. It's still a work in progress and is not yet in its final form. 

The front end is hosted on Netlify and the back end is hosted on Railway. You can see the live version at either:
